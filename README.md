# Biometric Authentication

This project implements biometric authentication using face and voice recognition techniques. It utilizes machine learning models for secure and reliable identity verification, with file access managed through HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). Built using Next.js for the client, FastAPI as a backend along with HDFS and PySpark for data processing.

This project is part of my coursework for Data Orchestration and Cloud Computing.
